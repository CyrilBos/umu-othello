# umu-othello

Artificial Intelligence assignment at the University of Ume√• (Sweden). This is an implementation of an Othello game AI, using Alpha-Beta pruning with Iterative Deepening Search based on several well-known heuristics. A simple Java basecode implementation of an Othello engine was given in order to make different AIs compete against themselves. 

Note: in the assignment, the first player to play (so the Max player in the MiniMax algorithm) is white instead of black.
